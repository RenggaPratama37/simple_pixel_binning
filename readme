# Simple Pixel Binning Image Upscaling Library

## Project Overview

The Simple Pixel Binning Image Upscaling Library is a Java-based project that uses native C code through Java Native Interface (JNI) to perform image upscaling. The library offers several image processing techniques, including pixel binning, Gaussian blur, smoothing, sharpening, denoising, gamma correction, and more. It is designed for high-performance image processing in Java or Android applications.

## Key Components

1. **Pixel Binning Algorithm (pixel_binning_twice.c and pixel_binning_quatro.c)**

   These modules implement pixel binning algorithms to upscale images. Pixel binning involves combining several pixels into one to reduce noise and improve image quality.

   - `pixel_binning_twice.c`: Implements pixel binning with a fixed 2x2 scale.
     - Function: `pixel_binning_twice(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, unsigned char* output)`
     - Purpose: Upscales the image by a factor of 2x2.

   - `pixel_binning_quatro.c`: Implements pixel binning with a fixed 4x4 scale.
     - Function: `pixel_binning_quatro(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, unsigned char* output)`
     - Purpose: Upscales the image by a factor of 4x4.

2. **Gaussian Blur (gaussian_blur.c)**

   Applies Gaussian blur to the image to reduce noise and soften details.

   - Function: `apply_gaussian_blur(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, unsigned char* output)`
   - Purpose: Smoothens the image by applying a Gaussian blur filter.

3. **Smoothing (smoothing.c)**

   Smoothens color transitions between pixels to make the image appear more polished.

   - Function: `apply_smoothing(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, unsigned char* output)`
   - Purpose: Applies a smoothing filter to improve pixel transitions.

4. **Sharpening (unsharp_masking.c and sobel_filter.c)**

   - Enhances image sharpness and clarifies details using unsharp masking.
     - Function: `apply_unsharp_masking(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, unsigned char* output)`
     - Purpose: Sharpens the image and enhances edges.

   - Performs edge detection and sharpening using the Sobel filter.
     - Function: `apply_sobel_filter(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, unsigned char* output)`
     - Purpose: Detects edges and enhances sharpness for clearer image details.

5. **Denoising (denoising.c)**

   Reduces noise in the image using a denoising filter.

   - Function: `apply_denoising(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, unsigned char* output)`
   - Purpose: Removes noise and smoothens the image.

6. **Gamma Correction (gamma_correction.c)**

   Adjusts the gamma of the image to correct brightness levels.

   - Function: `apply_gamma_correction(unsigned char* image, int width, int height, float gamma)`
   - Purpose: Corrects the gamma of the image to adjust brightness and contrast.

7. **JNI Integration (pixel_binning_jni.c)**

   Provides JNI bridge functions to interface Java with native C code.

   - Function: `Java_PixelBinning_upscale2x2(...)`
   - Purpose: Allows Java to call native methods for image processing.

8. **Java Class (PixelBinning.java)**

   Java class for interacting with the native library and performing image upscaling.

   ```java
   public class PixelBinning {
       static {
           System.loadLibrary("pixel_binning");
       }

       public native void upscale2x2(int[] inputImage, int width, int height, int[] outputImage);
   }
   ```

9. **Example Program (ImageExample.java)**

   Demonstrates how to use the PixelBinning class to read, process, and save images.

## Build and Usage Instructions

1. **Compiling the Native Library**

   Use the provided Makefile to compile the C/C++ code into a shared library (libpixel_binning.so).

   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. **Compiling the Java Code**

   Compile the Java files with:

   ```bash
   javac project/PixelBinning.java project/ImageExample.java
   ```

3. **Running the Java Program**

   Run the example program with:

   ```bash
   java -Djava.library.path=. project.ImageExample
   ```

   Ensure the shared library (libpixel_binning.so) is in the same directory or update the -Djava.library.path to point to the correct location.

4. **Using the Library in Your Own Project**

   To integrate the pixel binning functionality into your own project:

   - Include the PixelBinning.java file in your project.
   - Ensure libpixel_binning.so is in the runtime library path.
   - Use the PixelBinning class to process images.

   Example usage:

   ```java
   PixelBinning pb = new PixelBinning();
   int[] inputImage = { /* your image data */ };
   int[] outputImage = new int[scaledWidth * scaledHeight];
   pb.upscale2x2(inputImage, originalWidth, originalHeight, outputImage);
   ```

## Modifications and Customization

- **Upscaling with Different Scale Factors**

  You can adjust the pixel_binning_twice.c and pixel_binning_quatro.c for different scaling factors as needed.
